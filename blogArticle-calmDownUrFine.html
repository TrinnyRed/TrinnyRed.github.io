        <p>
            It's hard to tell because the media focuses on only the flashy, successful, controversial, really really cool stories, but the majority of the world is actually pretty average, bordering on mediocre. <br><br>

            Nobody knows that they're doing.<br><br>

The older you get, the more you'll notice: Companies are run by idiots, your bosses know less than you, mistakes happen daily in any establishment, things take longer than you think they should, your parents were wrong about so many things.<br><br>

People are panicked, confused, anxious. They are insomniacs. They get stuck in traffic. They forget their keys. They flirt with their committed coworkers. They make bad choices and invariably take the needlessly difficult path.<br><br>

Your life might seem like a dumpster fire, but rest assured, everybody's lives are dumpster fires. It doesn't matter who - that rich CEO with the million dollar paycheck, targeted by coworkers who want his status; that middle-class mom with the house and kids, and her secret browser folder to divorce lawyers' websites; that handsome young influencer with millions of followers, who drowns away his loneliness in serial relationships and alcohol.<br><br>

Nobody is spared. We're all idiots.  You're doing just fine.
