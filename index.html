        <h1>You can Change.</h1>

        <p>You find yourself stuck.</p>
            
        <p>Stuck in your family or bad relationships. You have no money, no partner, and no control over how your life plays out. You are frustrated, anxious, depressed. It's been like this for years, and may stay this way for decades more. Nothing will improve, and you'll die, lonely and pointless in a world that doesn't care.</p>

        <p>But the truth is, you can Change.</p>

        <p>You can Change your situation (external) to make it peaceful or exciting. You can Change your mindset (internal) to reach a sense of clarity and equilibrium. You can even become the Change that makes the world better.</p>
        
        <p>This Change begins with acknowledging the self. Acknowledging the self isn't easy - it's scary, uncomfortable, potentially triggering. But <strong>acknowleding what needs to change</strong> is the first step.</p>
        
        <p>How do you acknowledge what needs to change? How do you acknowledge the self?</p>
        
        <p>I'll show you. Let's take that <a href="BLOG-Select.html">first step</a> together.</p>
