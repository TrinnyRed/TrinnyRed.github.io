        <h1>You can Change.</h1>
        <p>You find yourself stuck. Stuck in your family or bad relationships. You have no money, no partner, no future, and no control over how your life plays out. You are frustrated, anxious, depressed. It's been like this for years, and may stay this way for decades more. Nothing will improve, and you'll die, sad and pointless in a world that doesn't care.</p>

        <p>But the truth is, you can Change.</p>

        <p>You can Change your situation (external) to make it better. You can Change your way of thinking and feeling (internal) to reach a sense of clarity and equilibrium. You can even become the Change that makes the world better.</p>
        
        <p>This Change begins with acknowledging the self. Acknowledging the self isn't easy - it's scary, uncomfortable, potentially triggering. But <strong>acknowledgment of what needs to change</strong> is the first step.</p>
        
        <p>Let's take that <a href="BLOG-Select.html">first step</a> together.</p>
