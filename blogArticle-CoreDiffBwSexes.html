            The core differences between the sexes (aside from the more obvious biological reproductive equipment) is actually not that much.<br><br>

Men and women aren't that different.<br><br>

They think pretty similarly. They have the same fears and desires as the opposite sex, and I think that the perceived differences are due to environmental treatment and expectations.<br><br>

Men and women get just as horny as each other. They both logic the same and have the same stupid sense of humor.<br><br>

I probably think this way because of 2 reasons. The first is that, as a daughter, I have a decent relationship to my dad. He's as "dad" as dad can be, with his dad jokes, and protectiveness, and understanding towards woman things (he grew up with a bunch of sisters).<br><br>

The second is that, as a sister, I grew up with a younger brother, and we were pretty close. Men aren't alien to me. I played, fought, discussed, supported, made fun of my sibling as an equal, and vice versa.<br><br>

I can imagine how your view of the opposite sex may be different based on your family structure, your society's culture, and your religion.<br><br>

Don't think of men or women as Other.<br><br>

They're just as weird, flawed, and fascinating as you.  You'll find a lot more in common than society likes to overcomplicate it.<br><br>
