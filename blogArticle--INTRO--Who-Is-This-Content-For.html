            Who is this content for?
        </h1>
        <p>
            This content is for anyone who is anxious, depressed, numb, or angry, with themselves, with their relationships, or with the world in general. This content will provide tools to identify the causes of those feelings, and some practicable steps to process them, integrate them, and grow from them.<br><br>

            <strong>Why am I making this?</strong><br><br>

Because in spite of all the good resources available for free online, I haven't found a framework that breaks down self-exploration, which starts with the acknowledgment that something is wrong. Or something isn't quite right. A framework that helps answer, “Is this normal?” Or, “Are there known explanations for these feelings?”<br><br>

For myself, I had a lot of loose ends and knowledge gaps. What helped me was <strong>School of Life's</strong> videos and articles on relationships, history, and philosophy. I am a survivor of a narcissistic relationship, and that's how <strong>Dr. Ramani's</strong> YouTube channel really lifted the veil for me on psychology. Then I wanted to get out of the capitalist rat race, but also wanted to do it ethically, so I needed financial literacy. What helped me there were business books my dad had read and vetted, then shared with me (<strong>Scott Galloway, Daniel Priestley, Donald Miller</strong>). Since I was a kid, I had been frustrated with the world, so to round off all the knowledge I've accumulated thus far on philosophy, ethics, and money, I somehow stumbled upon the illuminating channel <strong>What is Politics?</strong> on YouTube. (Links to all of the above in the <strong>Resources Section</strong>).
<br><br>

With this knowledge, I wanted to design a clearer path out of that vague sense of ignorance that slowly crushes your soul. For anyone else on this journey, I want to challenge your sense that this world is as good as it gets (is it?). That the pain you feel cannot be healed (can't it?). That the problem lies with you (does it really?).
<br><br>

I want to challenge your default mindset, and your unconscious belief that you won't, or can't, change - for a better, more peaceful life.<br><br>

You absolutely can change.
